/**
 * Public invoice endpoints — NO authentication, mounted at `/public/invoices`.
 *
 * Powers the hosted invoice page at `apps/dashboard/src/app/public/invoices/[token]/page.tsx`.
 * Only invoices in SENT / VIEWED / PARTIALLY_PAID / PAID / OVERDUE are
 * customer-viewable; DRAFT / CANCELLED / VOID return 404.
 *
 * No accept/reject (invoices aren't negotiable — that's what Quotes is for).
 * No payment UI in the renderer (Phase 2 — would need Stripe/Razorpay wiring).
 * The only side effect of a GET is fire-and-forget `markViewed`.
