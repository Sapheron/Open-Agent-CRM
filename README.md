## 🔄 Conversation Flow

Open Agent CRM uses a **conversation state machine (FSM)** for AI + human workflows:

```text
OPEN → AI_HANDLING → WAITING_HUMAN → HUMAN_HANDLING → RESOLVED → CLOSED
                  ↓
                SPAM
```

### Supported Workflow
- New inbound message
- AI auto-reply
- Tool execution
- Human escalation
- Agent claim
- Resolution
- Re-open on new message
